# VS Code, but Better â€” Kurukshetra Hackathon Project

## ðŸš€ Overview

**Kurukshetra Hackathon** is your next-generation coding environmentâ€”think **VS Code, but better**.  

We integrated **AI-driven enhancements** to make development smarter and faster:

- **ðŸ”Ž Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  
  We built a custom RAG model that retrieves relevant snippets from documentation and codebases before generating completions, making coding assistance context-aware and reliable.

- **ðŸ–§ MCP (Model-Container Protocol) Server:**  
  Our MCP Server manages model serving, context routing, and multi-session orchestrationâ€”ensuring fast and scalable AI support.

- **âš¡ Context Refinement Pipeline:**  
  Each response is passed through a multi-step refinement process that filters noise and improves precision so developers get only the **most relevant suggestions**.
